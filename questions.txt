1. What are the three uses of the curly brackets {} in Ruby?
Curly brackets are used for calling blocks, setting up hashes and string interpolation.

2. What is a regular expression and what is a common use for them?
Regular expression is used for pattern recognition in strings. You use them to test a string, extract a string or change a string. Often used for phone numbers, zip codes, credit card numbers, etc.
 
3. What is the difference between how a String, a symbol, a FixNum, and a Float are stored in Ruby?
A string is stored with quote marks, a symbol is stored with a colon, a FixNum is stored without any demarkation and a float is stored with a decimal.

4. Are these two statements equivalent? Why or Why Not?
  a. x, y = "hello", "hello"
  b. x = y = "hello"
No, because the "b" example is the value of x is pointing to the value of y, but the "a" example is explicitly assigning the value to both at the same time.

5. What is the difference between a Range and an Array?
A range is a sequence of values in a progressive order (ie. 1-10, a-z) with either an inclusive (..) or exclusive (...) range. An array does not have to be in a particular order or progression, but is simply assigned by index position in a collection.

6. Why would I use a Hash instead of an Array?
Hash is best used when you need a key, value pair. Like, for example, you want to set up a library program and you need to pair the book title with an ISBN number. An array is a good container to simply hold values.

7. What is your favorite thing about Ruby so far?
